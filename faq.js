const faqs=[{q:"What is MtF HRT and how does it work?",a:"MtF (male-to-female) HRT uses estrogen and anti-androgens to develop feminine characteristics and suppress testosterone. This process relieves gender dysphoria and causes physical and emotional changes similar to a second puberty.",sources:[{name:"Mayo Clinic",url:"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/feminizing-hormone-therapy/about/pac-20385096"},{name:"UCSF Transgender Care",url:"https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines/feminizing-hormone-therapy"}]},{q:"What medications are used in MtF HRT?",a:"Common medications include estradiol (estrogen), spironolactone or cyproterone acetate (anti-androgens), and sometimes progesterone. These medications feminize the body and suppress testosterone-driven traits.",sources:[{name:"Wikipedia",url:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminizing_hormone_therapy"},{name:"Endocrine Society Guidelines",url:"https://www.endocrine.org/clinical-practice-guidelines/gender-dysphoria-gender-incongruence"}]},{q:"What is the timeline of physical and emotional changes on HRT?",a:"Physical changes like breast growth, skin softening, and fat redistribution start within 3–6 months. Mental health typically improves, though mood swings may occur early on. Full effects may take 2–5 years.",sources:[{name:"Mayo Clinic",url:"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/feminizing-hormone-therapy/about/pac-20385096"},{name:"Medical News Today",url:"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mtf-hrt-body-changes"},{name:"WPATH Standards of Care",url:"https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc"}]},{q:"Which effects are permanent, and which reverse if I stop HRT?",a:"Breast growth and potential infertility are permanent. Most other effects like muscle loss, fat redistribution, and reduced libido reverse if hormones are stopped and testosterone returns to baseline.",sources:[{name:"Mayo Clinic",url:"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/feminizing-hormone-therapy/about/pac-20385096"},{name:"UCSF Transgender Care",url:"https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines/feminizing-hormone-therapy"}]},{q:"What are the risks and side effects of MtF HRT?",a:"HRT elevates your risk levels to match those of cis women, rather than creating new risks. This includes increased risk of blood clots, breast cancer, and cardiovascular issues - similar to what cis women experience.

Sperm banking is strongly recommended before starting HRT if you may want biological children later.
